# SVG Loader

## About
This project is a POC to display how we could be using currentColor with two-tone SVG icons.

Currently this assumes that a "master" svg is loaded to the page. This gives us the benefit of caching all icons. 

## Getting started
```
yarn install
yarn build
http-server // or any other lightweight server
// then go to http://localhost:8080
```
